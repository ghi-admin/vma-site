From Chains to Change is the remarkable story of Grace House-the former home of Dr. Valle, which he turned into a peer-run sober house for those struggling with addiction, co-occurring mental health disorders, and trauma after leaving prison or a treatment program. You will hear stories of hope and healing, including how the men and women at Grace House rescued Dr. Valle from the chains of his own clinical depression.

This is a book for anyone seeking a renewed perspective and real solutions for human transformation.
